# Java Career Growth 🚀 
=========================

This repository captures my continuous learning and hands-on work as a Java backend engineer with ~5+ years of industry experience. It includes production-style mini projects, system design explorations, and focused experiments across core Java, concurrency, Spring Boot, and scalable backend architectures. The goal of this repository is to deepen engineering fundamentals, practice real-world design trade-offs, and stay technically sharp.
